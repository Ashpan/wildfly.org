synopsis: Bootable JAR Maven plugin 4 has been released.

The version 4.0.0.Final of the link:https://github.com/wildfly-extras/wildfly-jar-maven-plugin/[WildFly Bootable JAR Maven plugin] has been released.

For people who are not familiar with WildFly Bootable JAR, I strongly recommend that you read 
this link:https://www.wildfly.org/news/2020/10/19/bootable-jar-2.0-released/[blog post] that covers it in detail. 

## WildFly CLI script executed at startup time 

Starting with WildFly 23 (that has been recently link:https://www.wildfly.org/news/2021/03/11/WildFly23-Final-Released/[announced]), the bootable JAR runtime allows to execute a WildFly CLI script when launching the bootable JAR. Although applying 
changes to the server configuration at build time is the preferred way (no impact on startup time), runtime execution gives you the flexibility
to adjust the server configuration to the execution context.

The link:https://github.com/wildfly-extras/wildfly-jar-maven-plugin/tree/4.0.0.Final/examples/authentication[authentication] example has been evolved
with a Maven profile to disable CLI script execution at build time in favor to runtime one.

To execute a CLI script during boot: `java -jar app-bootable.jar --cli-script=<path to CLI script>`

NOTE: This support is Tech Preview as the mechanism may change in later releases.

## JBoss Modules modules artifact upgrades

Starting with WildFly 23, you can upgrade part of the server when building a bootable JAR. 
 
This offers the ability to evolve an identified component of the server (eg: an undertow artifact, a JDBC driver
provided by a third party Galleon feature-pack, ...). Obviously the updated component must be compatible with the server in which it is deployed to...
This is done at your own risks ;-).

### WildFly Galleon feature-packs server artifact packaging

The way the JBoss Modules modules artifacts that compose a WildFly server are packaged inside a WildFly Galleon feature-packs 
allows to override their version when building a Bootable JAR. 

Instead of packaging the artifact binaries inside Galleon feature-packs, the artifacts Maven coordinates  
are packaged. The actual artifact files are resolved when a WildFly server is built using galleon (or when building a bootable JAR).  

This way of packaging artifacts is not new, WildFly follows this design pattern since the first Galleon releases (this is what allows to provision 
a slim WildFly server or a link:https://github.com/wildfly-extras/wildfly-jar-maven-plugin/tree/4.0.0.Final/examples/slim[slim WildFly bootable JAR]).

We encourage, when applicable (the artifacts must be released in an accessible Maven repository), to design custom Galleon feature-packs for WildFly by following this pattern. 

As an example, the link:https://github.com/wildfly-extras/wildfly-datasources-galleon-pack[WildFly datasources Galleon feature-pack] (that provides drivers and datasources 
for some major database) pom file contains in its link:https://github.com/wildfly-extras/wildfly-datasources-galleon-pack/blob/1.2.3.Final/pom.xml#L49[dependencies] 
the driver artifacts that it can bring to the server.

The JBoss Modules modules that contain the driver artifacts (e.g.: link:https://github.com/wildfly-extras/wildfly-datasources-galleon-pack/blob/1.2.3.Final/src/main/resources/modules/org/postgresql/jdbc/main/module.xml#L4[postgresql driver module])  
only reference the GroupId and ArtifactId of the artifact. The artifacts versions are stored inside the feature-pack but outside of the JBoss Modules module.
This is this separation between the GroupId, ArtifactId (optionally Classifier) and the Version that makes the upgrade possible when building a bootable JAR.

The link:https://docs.wildfly.org/bootablejar[WildFly bootable JAR] documentation contains more information about this capability.

## MyFaces Galleon feature-pack

I take the opportunity of this blog post to mention a new community link:https://github.com/melloware/wildfly-myfaces-galleon-pack[project] that defines Galleon feature-packs 
that you can use with WildFly 23 Galleon feature-pack (and "WildFly Preview" Galleon feature-pack) to build a 
Bootable JAR (or to provision a server using Galleon) containing a jsf implementation based on link:https://myfaces.apache.org[MyFaces].

## Known issues

### Incompatibility with Keycloak client adapter Galleon feature-pack

Due to some incompatible changes in WildFly Galleon feature-pack (removal of core and servlet Galleon feature-packs in the dependency chain) 
Keycloak 12.0.x OIDC client adapter Galleon feature-pack can't be used with WildFly 23 Galleon feature-pack. 

As a workaround, we have setup a link:https://github.com/jfdenise/wildfly-bootable-jar-keycloack-zipped-adapter[project] that highlights the workaround you need to follow to include keycloak 12.0.x OIDC client adapter inside a WildFly 23 
bootable JAR. In summary, we are including in the bootable JAR the content of the keycloak zipped client adapter (that you can download from link:https://www.keycloak.org/downloads[keycloak downloads]). 
In addition the server security is configured by the `adapter-elytron-install.cli` WildFly CLI script that is packaged in the zipped adapter.

## To conclude

Finally we would really appreciate that you keep us posted with your feedback and new requirements (that you can log as new 
link:https://github.com/wildfly-extras/wildfly-jar-maven-plugin/issues[project issues]), this will help evolve the WildFly Bootable JAR experience in the right direction.

Thank-you!
