What is WildFly Swarm?
----------------------

*WildFly Swarm* is a new sidecar project to WildFly which helps
you create self-contained Java microservices based upon the
normal WildFly application-server.

How do I use WildFly Swarm?
---------------------------

Currently, the easiest way to use WildFly Swarm is through
your Maven build.  We do aim to add support for other build-systems
in the near future.

Decide whichever portions of WildFly you need, and add matching
dependencies to your `pom.xml`:

[source,xml]
<dependency>
  <groupId>org.wildfly.swarm</groupId>
  <artifactId>wildfly-swarm-undertow</artifactId>
</dependency>

Of course, some dependencies imply others, since Maven transitively
resolves them.

This, for instance, implies `wildfly-swarm-undertow`, along with providing
your application with the JAX-RS APIs:

[source,xml]
----------------------------
<dependency>
  <groupId>org.wildfly.swarm</groupId>
  <artifactId>wildfly-swarm-jaxrs</artifactId>
</dependency>
----------------------------

To make your project aware of WildFly Swarm capabilities, configure
the plugin:

[source,xml]
----------------------------
<plugin>
  <groupId>org.wildfly.swarm</groupId>
  <artifactId>wildfly-swarm-plugin</artifactId>
  <executions>
    <execution>
      <goals>
        <goal>package</goal>
      </goals>
    </execution>
  </executions>
</plugin>
----------------------------


How do I run my application?
----------------------------

You can run your application from your IDE by specifying either
your own `main()` class, or simply executing `org.wildfly.swarm.Swarm`.
This will boot the default container with all the parts specified
within your `pom.xml` and deploy your simple `.war` file.

If you want to run from the command-line using maven:

`mvn wildfly-swarm:run`

If you're not building a `.war` and want more control, you can write
your own `main()` method, constructing a container and deploying
whatever deployments you wish:

[source,java]
----------------------------
import org.wildfly.swarm.container.Container;
import org.wildfly.swarm.container.Deployment;

public class MyMain {

    public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception {

        Container container = new Container();

        Deployment deployment = ...

        container.start();
        container.deploy(deployment);
    }
}
----------------------------

If you provide your own `main()`, be certain to add a `<configuration>`
block to your `pom.xml`

[source,xml]
----------------------------
<plugin>
  <groupId>org.wildfly.swarm</groupId>
  <artifactId>wildfly-swarm-plugin</artifactId>
  <configuration>
    <mainClass>com.bigcorp.myservice.MyMain</mainClass>
  </configuration>
  <executions>
    <execution>
      <goals>
        <goal>package</goal>
      </goals>
    </execution>
  </executions>
</plugin>
----------------------------

In your IDE, simply run your `main()` directly.  If you use the `wildfly-swarm:run`
Maven plugin, it will use the value specified by your `mainClass` in the plugin configuration.

What about an uberjar?
----------------------

The `wildfly-swarm-maven-plugin` has a `package` goal which will create
an uberjar (fat-jar) of your project, which contains all dependencies and
is executable.

Then you execute `mvn package`, in your `target/` directory you'll find
another artifact with the suffix of `-swarm.jar`.

Simply `java -jar ./target/myapp-swarm-jar` and it'll run.
